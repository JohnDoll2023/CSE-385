				<note noteNum="1" author="Hoya">Well, I wanted an idea of where my fitness was, and I got it - not good. I have some work ahead of me, but that's ok. At ;least I like the training part. Splits were 6:18, 6:33, 6:34, 6:07, 6:08, 6:19, 6:26, 6:32, 6:33, 6:47, 7:00, 6:25, 6:34, 0:40.
Goal was to run 6:20 pace. Was on pace at half way, then things started to come apart. Forgot how long this race is and that you need to a better job of "settleing" in over the first 5 miles. Will have a better feel for the distance next time.</note>

			<notes dayTitle="Hilly Progression Run">
				<note noteNum="1" author="Hoya">Out the door at 5:10am.  Ran 2.9/2.9 wrm/cld.  To CP, up east side drive to 102nd then 5x northern loop.  Nice progression per loop ending in a 6:15 pace last loop.  Loop was run CW to include both big hills in harlem portion of park.  See intervals for splits.

Left foot a little sore.  Wearing Vitruvian's yesterday aggrevated them.  Those shoes not so good for that injury.  Otherwise felt good.

Started a screwy "apple diet" I read about on letsrun.  Never a good idea to get ideas from that site.  =)  Directly before every meal eat 1 or 2 apples.</note>

Towards the end of the run did 8 striders on the trail.  Everything felt good and the long night of sleep was awesome  =)</note>

This morning, out the door at 4:30.  Ran 1xBPN, then 3xrez.  Loops in 19:25(7:46), 11:15(7:08), 10:40(6:46), 12:01(7:37).

BPN was run fairly easy with headlamp.  First rez did lamp post pick-ups and half way through started running hard with no breaks.  Second rez hard, last rez easy.  Quads sore, but otherwise felt fine.</note>

Left hip still a little sore as I started out, but ok thereafter.

				<note noteNum="1" author="Hoya">Out the door at 4:45 am.  Ran on park road until some light in the sky then switched to the bridle path.  Threw in surges early and often.  Felt good to go at will and not be tied to anything - including where I was running.  Switches courses whenever I felt like it.  I felt pretty loose, but need to try and make more on an effort to stretch b/c hammies are tight.  Birds were singing nicely today.  Also thought about taking more time to do pre-dawn time exposure photos in the park.  Some really interesting/beautiful scenes.

About 3-4 weeks out from baby coming.  Jeanette really tired but being a trooper.</note>

				<note noteNum="1" author="Hoya">Got to run later this morning as Jeanette didn't have to go in to work today.  Felt pretty good.  Happened to run into Maurice while out and joined him.  He pushed the pace a little on me, but not too bad.  A bit humid out, but cool weather.  Got some good stretching in after the run.  Been doing that the last couple of days and hoping to keep that up.</note>

BPN loops in 16:58 (6:47), 16:30(6:36).  Patience ... Patience, and consistency.  That's what this running thing is all about.  Keep up the work and look far down the road.

				<note noteNum="1" author="Hoya">Pleasant rain in CP while running with Corey and Jim.  Trees so leafy and green right now.  As much as I complain about the weather sometimes, the seasons really are nice.  You just have to spend the time to appreciate their differences.

Felt good during the run.  However, remember not to wear the Vitruvians on BPN again is it is rainy.  The wide ankle collar on the shoes atract pebbles.  Caused irritation and some bleeding above my heel.  Probabl;y also due to the "sockletes" that I wore.

It was really nice to run with these guys again.  Conversation is so easy and the miles role by effortlessly

Patience...patience...</note>

				<note noteNum="1" author="Hoya">Nice exploratory run in Blooklyn and Queens.  Ran to the Queensboro bridge, south along the water in Greenpoint, across the Polaski bridge into Brooklyn and then through Williamsburg until I got to the Willamsburg bridge and north on 1st Ave.

I had some pain behind my left knee for the first few miles, but then the pain faded.

The run ended up being shorter than I had anticipated.  Had hoped to run 14 to 15 miles.  It's ok, slow buildup - no need to overdo it.</note>

Wrist has healed enough that I can do some push-ups again.  Can't go nuts, but it's a start.  Also, seem to be starting to loose a little weight.

It's all about the consistency and patience.</note>

No other issues.  Girl called Stefani joined us for a bit.  She's into doing many Ultras and adventure races and used to be a professional cyclist, now is a freelance sports writer.  Very interesting.

Patience, patience...</note>

I couldn't find my watch so pace is completely a guess, but distance is accurate.  Decided yesterday not to do the race tomorrow.  I want to give my fitness more time to improve before I test it again.

Ate like a complete pig yesterday - need to cut that out.  Seemed to eat every carb I laid my eyes on and not much else.  Retaining a lot of water this morning.  Plus, enhaling almost the entire pint of B&amp;J Chunky Monkey didn't help either.</note>

Ran first two in 34:51(6:58) and the last one in 15:53 (6:21).  Corey fell off the pace over the last mile but I managed to stay with Jim.  I think Corey needs a little more of a break from the racing after Boston to get his fire and legs back completely.</note>

Nothing to be alarmed about.  Started logging my runs on the Nike log yesterday too.  I guess I may end up ditching this log.  The nike one is better, but I have a fondness for this one now.  I suppose I could double log - would minimize the chances on me losing data.</note>

PM: Went to CPTC workout.  Workout included 1 mile, 0.8 mile, 1 mile.  Recoveries varied but generally were short.  Splits were 5:51, 4:50, 6:13.  Faded hard, and just plain went out too hard.  Probably should have run with the C group, but instead ran with the C group.  Next time I'll join C.</note>

				<note noteNum="1" author="Hoya">Was just going to run easy today, but had an oppurtunity to run with the faster guys this morning so I took advantage.  Group was as big as 6 people at one point zipping around the BPN.  Lots of funa dn laughs this morning.  Weather was cooler and slight drizzle.  The only times sections I have were in the middle 18:55 (7:34), 18:10 (7:16)BPNs.  Pushed harder after that.  In the end it was Jim, Corey and Me.  Got to see Brad this morning and ran for a while with Neil too.  He was off to a conference in Philly and was debating trying to get in another loop and risk missing his train.</note>
